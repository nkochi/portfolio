        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <img src="assets/images/mypic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="placeholder">

        <p>My name is Noora Kochi. When I was 13 years old my whole family moved to the United States. This was such an important
          event in my life because everything in my life changed so much. At first I felt afraid because of the cultural
          and the language barrier but after a while I slowly learned to accept the culture and worked hard to learn how
          to speak English.</p>

        <p>After high school I attended California State University at Hayward and now it is called CSU at East Bay. I am the
          first female in my whole family to finish high school and graduate from college. I worked twice as hard as other
          students due to the fact that I have been studying English only for five years before attanding college. I graduated
          with a BS in Computer Information Systems and got a job in the technical industry.</p>

        <p>I moved to Arizona in 2006 to start a company with a friend. I am proud to say that I was the first financial investor
          in the company, Iveda Solution. I went into my own business and after seven years I decided to take a break. Now,
          I am currently attending a bootcamp at University of Arizona and expect to complet the program at the end of July
          2018.</p>
